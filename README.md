# Asymptotic Distribution of One-Component Partial Least Squares

This repository contains R scrips to reproduce the tables and figures
from the paper:

Asymptotic distribution of one-component partial least
squares regression estimators in high dimension
by Jeronimo Basa, Dennis Cook, Liliana Forzani and Miguel Marcos
accepted for publication in Canadian Journal of Statistics


Thank you for your interest in our work.

Every script has the package needed to run the scrips.

The files are:

- Figure1.R: to reproduce Figure 1 of the paper
- Table2: to reproduce Table 2 of the paper
- Table3: to reproduce Table 3 of the paper
- Mcal1 and ycal1: data needed for reproducing Table 3
- howmany.R a function that counts how many times a quantity belongs to a sequence of intervals needed for Table 3
